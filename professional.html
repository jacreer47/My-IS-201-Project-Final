I would support the kitchen team wherever needed, whether it was  assembling food orders quickly and accurately, maintaining cleanliness, and working for order continuously.

At times, I would need to manage the store while leadership was absent, requiring coordination of fellow team members, training, and directing orders, mail, and checking in and out packages from multiple companies.

                                As a Counselor, I supervised groups of 14-20 youth each week and guided them in activities in lessons focused on strengthening their talents, knowledge, and social interactions with each other. The position required multi-tasking constantly, striving to be time efficient to ensure all youth were able to participate in the 20+  activities offered in the camp. I also had to coordinate and work with 50 or more staff members each week, adapting to each of them to create the most unified work environment we could.
